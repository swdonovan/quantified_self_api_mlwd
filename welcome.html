<h1>Welcome to Mimi and Wil's Quantified Self API!</h1>

The following endpoints are available. All endpoints will return the data as JSON.

<h2>Food Endpoints:</h2>

<ul>
  <li><code>GET /api/v1/foods</code> - returns all foods currently in the database</li>
  <li><code>GET /api/v1/foods/:id</code> - returns the food object with the specific <code>:id</code> you've passed in or 404 if the food is not found</li>
  <li><code>POST /api/v1/foods</code> - allows creating a new food with the parameters:<br> 
    <code>{ food: { name: "Name of food here", calories: "Calories here"} }</code><br>
    If food is successfully created, the food item will be returned. If the food is not successfully created, a 400 status code will be returned. Both name and calories are required fields.</li>
  <li><code>PATCH /api/v1/foods/:id</code> - allows one to update an existing food with the parameters:<br>
    <code>{ food: { name: "Name of food here", calories: "Calories here"} }</code><br>
If food is successfully updated (name and calories are required fields), the food item will be returned. If the food is not successfully updated, a 400 status code will be returned.
<li><code>DELETE /api/v1/foods/:id</code> - will delete the food with the id passed in. If the food can't be found, a 404 will be returned.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Meal Endpoints:</h2>

<ul>
  <li><code>GET /api/v1/meals</code> - returns all the meals in the database along with their associated foods</li>
  <li><code>GET /api/v1/meals/:meal_id/foods</code> - returns all the foods associated with the meal with an id specified by :meal_id or a 404 if the meal is not found</li>
  <li><code>POST /api/v1/meals/:meal_id/foods/:id</code> - adds the food with <code>:id</code> to the meal with <code>:meal_id</code><br>
    This creates a new record in the MealFoods table to establish the relationship between this food and meal. If the meal/food cannot be found, a 404 will be returned.</li>
  <li><code>DELETE /api/v1/meals/:meal_id/foods/:id</code> - removes the food with <code>:id</code> from the meal with <code>:meal_id</code><br>
    This deletes the existing record in the MealFoods table that creates the relationship between this food and meal. If the meal/food cannot be found, a 404 will be returned.</li>
</ul>
